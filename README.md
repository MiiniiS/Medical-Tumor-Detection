# ðŸ§¬ Medical Tumor Detection

**Medical-Tumor-Detection** is a machine learningâ€“based project designed to **predict and classify tumor presence** using **structured medical data** such as patient demographics, clinical measurements, and laboratory results.  
The goal is to build an interpretable, data-driven model that supports early tumor diagnosis and enhances medical decision-making through **data visualization** and **predictive analytics**.

## ðŸ“– Overview

Unlike image-based tumor detection, this project focuses on **tabular medical data**.  
The workflow includes:
1. Data preprocessing and feature engineering  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visual insights  
3. Model training and evaluation using ML algorithms  
4. Performance visualization (ROC curve, confusion matrix, feature importance)
